# VPC

One VPC, One region.

VPC is a virtual network or data center inside AWS for one client, or a department in an enterprise.

For example, you have a test VPC, and when the test is finished, you can transfer it to a production VPC.

Something like you have your own private data center in AWS, which is logically isolated from others.
